# File Exchange System

Introduction

This is a File Exchange System that allows clients to conveniently store, share, and retrieve files through a centralized server using either TCP or UDP protocols. The system comprises two main components: a server application and a client application.

Client Application

The client application acts as the user interface for interacting with the File Exchange System.
The client offers an input field to accept various commands for managing files.
The client application should also contain an output area to display server status from other users as well as system messages from the interaction of the client and the server application.

Server Application

The server application would function as the service or program where client applications would connect to, in order to interact with other clients in the File Exchange Application
